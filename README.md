# responsive-webpage-template

**Heroku no longer supported on GitHub**. Relevant issues will be addressed as they arrive.

âœ…**GitHub Actions** is not supported right now. Issue "No Worries #71" has more information. There is no need for GitHub Actions right now with the new designs as this project is agreed upon by 100% of the creators and participants to not need GitHub Actions right now. New participants may request GitHub Actions support if they like.

_responsive does not yet fully integrate a framework like ReactJS, here in apm-world_web-1_1 development. responsive may begin to be implemented asap with the new addition of Flutter to the workflow._
