### AdvocacyOS: A Personal Operating System for Justice
AdvocacyOS is a powerful and innovative digital tool designed to empower individuals with physical disabilities in their self-advocacy efforts. It provides a secure and private system for documenting discrimination, managing advocacy, and building a robust body of evidence. Think of it as a personal, private, and secure "operating system" for justice [1, 2].

#### The Core Problem
Individuals with disabilities frequently encounter systemic discrimination. Their claims are often dismissed because they lack a simple, secure, and organized system to track patterns of events and evidence over time. The burden of proof is high, and existing tools are often inadequate, leading to a cycle of vulnerability and injustice [6, 7].

#### The Solution: A Personal Fortress for Evidence
AdvocacyOS empowers users by transforming their lived experiences into a structured, chronologically-ordered, and easily shareable case file. It is not a social platform but a **personal fortress for evidence** [6, 7].

#### Key Features
*   **Incident Ledger**: A simple, time-stamped journal to log every interaction or incident of discrimination as it occurs [8, 9].
*   **Evidence Vault**: A secure, encrypted space to upload and tag supporting files like screenshots, documents, photos, and audio recordings [8, 9].
*   **Case File Management**: The ability to create separate case files for different matters (e.g., "Housing Dispute," "SNAP Benefits Case") and tag evidence to the relevant case [8, 9].
*   **Automated Timeline Generator**: The "killer feature" that automatically generates a clean, chronological timeline of events from a case file, which can be exported as a PDF [8, 9].
*   **Secure Sharing Portal**: Generate a secure, time-limited, read-only link to a case file's timeline to share with trusted parties like an attorney or legal aid worker [8, 9].
*   **Advocacy Resource Hub**: A curated in-app library with links to national and local resources like the ADA network, legal aid societies, and tenant rights organizations [8, 9].

#### Core Principles
##### Empowerment Through Tools, Not Prescription
AdvocacyOS is designed to empower, not prescribe. It provides a powerful tool to help users navigate their *own* unique journey, acting as a **compass rather than a map** [10, 11]. It embodies the "Ayurveda Tycoon" model: using technology and systematic thinking (the Tycoon) to achieve balance and justice (the Ayurveda) [10, 11].

##### Strategic Disengagement
A fundamental principle integrated into AdvocacyOS is **strategic disengagement** [10, 11]. Ableist attacks are designed to drain an individual's energy. Arguing is a trap [10, 11].
Strategic disengagement is a conscious act of power. Instead of engaging a bad-faith actor, the user disengages from the abuser and immediately **engages with AdvocacyOS** [12, 13]. By documenting the incident, the user transforms the attack into a piece of evidence, turning negativity into strength and reclaiming their sovereignty [12, 13].

#### The Evolution: AdvocacyOS with Gemini AI ü§ñ
AdvocacyOS has evolved to integrate AI, providing the disability community with immediate access to powerful advocacy tools governed by a revolutionary transparency model [13].

##### The Challenge: Need vs. Trust
1.  **Immediate Need**: Individuals with disabilities require urgent, intelligent assistance for complex bureaucratic and legal challenges [12, 14].
2.  **The Trust Gap**: Generic AI models are not trained on the nuances of disability advocacy and may provide unsafe or inaccurate information [12, 14].

##### The Solution: Community-Validated AI
AdvocacyOS uses a specialized interface for Google's Gemini AI backend, featuring a multi-layered, transparent evaluation system. This system allows users to not only receive answers but also to participate in validating the quality and safety of those answers for the entire community [14, 15].

##### The "Stax-like" Feedback & Evaluation Workflow
This innovative approach to transparency is central to the AI-powered AdvocacyOS [15, 16]:
1.  **User Query**: A user asks Gemini a question (e.g., "Help me draft an email to my landlord about a reasonable accommodation request") [15, 16].
2.  **AI Response**: The user receives a generated response [15, 16].
3.  **"Stax-like" Rating**: The user rates the response on multiple facets [15, 16]:
    *   **Accuracy**: Was the information factually correct? [15, 16]
    *   **Safety**: Was the advice safe and responsible? [15, 16]
    *   **Tone**: Was the language empowering and respectful? [15, 16]
    *   **Actionability**: Did the response offer a practical solution? [15, 16]
4.  **Multi-Layered Evaluation**: The rated interaction is passed to a secure review console where [15, 16]:
    *   **Peer Evaluation**: A trusted, vetted group of other users reviews the interaction [15, 16].
    *   **Principal Evaluation**: The project lead performs a final review and synthesizes feedback to establish a final quality score [15, 16].
