##### New Note
#### UI/UX Wireframes: The Capability Engine
This document outlines the basic user flow and screen layouts for the module. The design prioritizes a gentle, supportive, and non-overwhelming user experience [1].

##### **Screen 1: The Compassionate Check-In**
**Goal:** Guide the user through a simple, one-question-at-a-time check-in to assess their current state without pressure [1].

**Flow:**
1.  **Initial Screen:**
    *   Good morning [1].
    *   Let's check in. How is your energy level right now [1]?
        *   [Slider or 5 selectable buttons: 1 (Very Low) to 5 (Very High)] [1]
        *   [Next Button] [1]
2.  **Second Screen (after energy is selected):**
    *   Got it. Are you noticing any specific physical limitations or pain today [1]?

        *   [Next Button] [1]
3.  **Final Screen:**

        *   [Text Input Field for optional notes] [1]
        *   [Finish Check-In Button] [1]

##### **Screen 2: The Adaptive "Now" Agenda**
**Goal:** Transition seamlessly from the check-in to a live, actionable agenda that respects the user's current state [2].

**Flow:**
1.  **Transition & Suggestion:**
    *   I hear that your energy is at a **2** and you're feeling some **joint pain**. Let's build a day that respects that [2].

        *   [Create Plan Button] [2]
2.  **Live Agenda View (after plan is created):**
