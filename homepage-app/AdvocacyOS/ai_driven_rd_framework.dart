### Introduction: A Strategic Shift to AI-Driven Estimation
This document outlines a strategic shift in the "Life-System Integration & R&D" framework. Instead of using personal time to conduct manual, experimental R&D (e.g., timing appliance energy usage), the new approach leverages an advanced AI model as a strategic consultant. This is a more efficient, higher-leverage use of time, aligning with the "Ayurveda Tycoon" model. The AI will generate baseline estimates and optimal workflows, allowing the project to start with a data-driven plan.

### 1. Methodology: Strategic Prompt Engineering
The core of this framework is the use of carefully engineered prompts to extract specific, actionable data from the AI model. The AI's responses will provide the initial estimates before any real-world experiments are conducted.

### 1.1. Prompt for Energy Efficiency (Reheating Meal)
```
Based on general principles of thermodynamics and typical energy consumption of modern kitchen appliances, compare the probable electricity usage (in kWh) of reheating a single-serving, pre-cooked meal from the refrigerator to a standard eating temperature using an electric stovetop versus a countertop electric pressure cooker. Provide a percentage estimate of the potential energy savings.

### 1.2. Prompt for Physical Asset Liquidation
```
Create a project plan for liquidating 50 non-essential items from a storage unit. Break down the process into key phases: inventory/sorting, research/pricing, photography/listing, and packing/shipping. Provide a realistic time estimate in hours for each phase, assuming the goal is to maximize capital return.

### 1.3. Prompt for Digital Asset Conversion
```
Outline a scalable workflow for digitizing 3 standard file boxes of physical documents. The goal is to create organized, secure digital files while minimizing physical clutter. Provide a time estimate in hours for the entire process, including scanning, OCR processing, and a simple tagging/organization scheme.
