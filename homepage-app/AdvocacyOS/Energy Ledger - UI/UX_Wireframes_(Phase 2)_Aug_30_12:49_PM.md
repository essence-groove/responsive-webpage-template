# UI Wireframe: The Holistic Energy Ledger

This document outlines the visual layout and user flow for the main screen of the Energy Ledger. It is designed to be simple, scannable, and non-judgmental, adhering to our core UI/UX principles.

## Screen Layout: Main Ledger View

**Goal:** Provide an at-a-glance view of the user's energy balance and allow for one-tap logging of both "Credits" and "Debits."

### 1. Energy Balance Visualization (Top of Screen)

*   **Component:** A simple, horizontal bar graph.
*   **Labels:** The bar is labeled "Depleted" on the left and "Replenished" on the right.
*   **Visuals:** The bar fills from left to right with a soft, neutral color (e.g., a calm blue or teal). It is explicitly not a percentage or a hard number, but a qualitative indicator that shifts gently based on the last few days of logged entries.
*   **Placement:** Positioned prominently at the top of the screen for instant, at-a-glance feedback.

### 2. Logging Sections (Main Content Area)

The screen is divided into two clear, distinct sections, each with a grid of selectable tags.

#### Section A: "Log an Energy Deposit"

*   **Header Color:** A calming green.
*   **Layout:** A grid of tappable cards. Each card contains a simple icon and a short text label.
*   **Example Tags (with conceptual icons):**
    *   [Icon: Water Drop] Hydrated Well
    *   [Icon: Apple] Nutritious Meal
    *   [Icon: Moon] Quality Sleep
    *   [Icon: Stretching Figure] Gentle Movement
    *   [Icon: Sun] Time Outside
    *   [Icon: Heart] Positive Connection

#### Section B: "Log an Energy Withdrawal"

*   **Header Color:** A neutral grey.
*   **Layout:** A similar grid of tappable cards.
*   **Example Tags (with conceptual icons):**
    *   [Icon: Fast Food] Processed Food
    *   [Icon: Skipped Plate] Skipped Meal
    *   [Icon: Weight] Overexertion
    *   [Icon: Clock] Skipped Rest
    *   [Icon: Storm Cloud] Stressful Event
    *   [Icon: Broken Z's] Poor Sleep

## User Interaction Flow

1.  User opens the Energy Ledger screen. They immediately see their current "Energy Balance".
2.  User taps a tag. For example, they tap the "[Icon: Apple] Nutritious Meal" card.
3.  A gentle, non-blocking confirmation appears. A small banner or "toast" message shows at the bottom of the screen for a few seconds with the text: "Noted. Thank you for taking that time for yourself."
4.  The "Energy Balance" bar subtly adjusts. The bar animates smoothly to reflect the new positive entry.
5.  The user can immediately tap another tag or navigate away. The process is complete.

This design directly implements our principles: it's frictionless (one tap to log), visual, and uses non-judgmental framing with gentle reinforcement, creating a safe and supportive tool for building self-awareness. The content and core concepts of this wireframe are identical to the previously reviewed document "Energy Ledger - UI/UX_Wireframes_(Phase 2)_Aug_30_12:49_PM.md".
